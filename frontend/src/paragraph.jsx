        Hey there! I'm Yash — a recent high school graduate passionate about building cool and meaningful projects. 
        I’m currently learning by doing, experimenting with technologies, 
        and constantly pushing myself to grow as a developer.
        I love combining functionality with clean design. Python is my favorite language, and 
        I’m currently learning full-stack web development using it.
        So far, I’ve worked with tools like React, Flask, Bootstrap, Git, and VS Code. I learn by building, 
        and yap yap yap yap yap yap
